Hello. I am a PhD student at Sabanci University Political Science Department. I also worked as a researcher in VRL Lab from July 2022 to July 2023. My study areas are political economy, and political behaviour and I am interested in quantitative and computational methods. 

I earned my BA in Political Science and Public Administration from Bilkent University. I earned my MA degree in Political Economy from the University of Essex and an MSc in Political Science and Public Administration from Middle East Technical University. I previously studied the impact of austerity measures on European political parties and the characteristics of the populist party electorate in Europe. I also have teaching experience as a teaching assistant at Sabanci University's university-wide courses SPS 101 and SPS 102. I earned a first-place award for teaching assistants in 2022.
